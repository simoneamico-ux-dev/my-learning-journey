### The Project
Interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game developed with vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation and complete game logic. A review project that consolidates all concepts learned so far.

### The Cognitive Intensity of Review

This project was quite cognitively demanding, although it was composed of only 6 steps, each one required me to conduct a total review of most of the concepts learned.

The vademecum fit like a glove and it was super interesting to modify it as I progressed.

You could say this project functioned as a "validator" of the vademecum: I based myself on it and improved it precisely based on concepts that needed greater clarity, completeness and also the addition of more concise and efficient syntax.

### The Challenge of "JavaScript Only"

Sometimes, like this time, you don't start by writing HTML and CSS, but with JavaScript alone. I admit it weighed on me quite a bit, like the other times, because I want to carry projects through from A to Z.

### What I Learned

**Advanced Game Logic:**
- `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` for random generation
- Logic functions with boolean returns to determine winners
- State management with global variables (`playerScore`, `computerScore`)

**Complex DOM Manipulation:**
- `document.getElementById()` for specific elements
- `document.querySelector()` for CSS selectors
- `innerText` for dynamic content updates
- `style.display` for conditional show/hide

**Event Handling Mastery:**
- `addEventListener()` with callback functions
- Multiple event listeners for different buttons
- Event handling for game reset and restart

**Conditional Game Flow:**
- Ternary operators for dynamic messages
- Complex if/else logic to determine results
- Game state checks for game end

**Function Architecture:**
- `getRandomComputerResult()` - computer random selection
- `hasPlayerWonTheRound()` - victory logic
- `getRoundResults()` - complete round management
- `showResults()` - UI update
- `resetGame()` - initial state restoration

**JavaScript Patterns Observed:**
- Return statements with complex logic
- Template literals for dynamic messages
- Boolean logic for game mechanics

### Reflection

This project really validated my vademecum! It was incredible to see how every concept fit together perfectly and how the vademecum guided me through every step.
