**Nutrition Label – Learn Typography Project**

What I Learned:
- Structuring a real-world nutrition label with semantic HTML and CSS
- Typography: font weights, sizes, alignment, and spacing
- Customizing lines, borders, and layout for a real-life look
- CSS tricks for indentation, divider styles, and aligning numbers
- How to analyze real nutrition labels and recreate them from scratch

Time: 1 hour 45 minutes  
(Most of it built in the airport before my flight back to Torino, finished right after getting home because I couldn't wait!)

Personal Note:  
This project was seriously enjoyable, probably because nutrition labels are part of my everyday life with bodybuilding. I went beyond the freeCodeCamp steps, I checked real labels on Google and tried to replicate their layout and style using only what I’ve learned so far. Not every experiment worked, but every mistake taught me something new. The more I code, the more confident I get—and the more I realize how much more there is to explore. It's like a matryoshka doll, every time you open a layer, there’s another inside, even more detailed and interesting.

Next: Keep expanding my real-world HTML/CSS vademecum, and move on to the next freeCodeCamp project!
