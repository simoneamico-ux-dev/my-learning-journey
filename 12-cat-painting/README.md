# Cat Painting - freeCodeCamp Project

### The Project
Cat painting created entirely with CSS, using advanced techniques like absolute positioning, transform, border-radius, and linear gradients.

### The Development Experience

I really enjoyed it! It took me less than a weekend to finish it. I didn't just execute the code as requested, but as I often do, I go and modify the various values and sometimes try to reach the solution in different ways from those in the assignment. I experimented creating different shapes specifically to test the techniques I learned.

### The Experimental Approach

Most of the time I don't manage to find working alternative solutions, not yet being master of the subject, but sometimes I do. I'll mention an interesting one that made me understand an important concept.

### An Interesting Question

I asked the Code Tutor a question about a part of the code:

**"If the result is always 4rem, why not simply write:**
```css
min-width: 4rem;
max-width: 4rem;
```

**Instead of:**
```css
width: 100vw;
min-width: 4rem;
max-width: 4rem;
```

**The answer:** From a practical standpoint, **it works the same!**

It's like saying:
- **Long method:** "I want the whole buffet, but maximum one slice of pizza and minimum one slice"
- **Short method:** "I want one slice of pizza"

**Result:** In both cases you eat one slice of pizza.

The difference is in **clarity of intention** and compatibility with very old browsers, but for the specific case my more direct approach worked perfectly.

### Important Reflection

I know these tools tend to reinforce bias, like confirmation bias in this case, but this time the question led to a genuine understanding of a fundamental CSS concept. I discovered that often in CSS there are multiple ways to achieve the same result.

### What I Learned

- **Absolute positioning** to create complex shapes
- **Transform and rotate** to orient elements
- **Border tricks** to create geometric shapes
- **Z-index** to manage overlapping
- **Linear gradients** for color effects
- **The importance of experimenting** beyond instructions
