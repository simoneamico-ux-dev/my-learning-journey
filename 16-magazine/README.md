### The Project
Digital magazine developed with CSS Grid, replicating the typical layout of a magazine with columns, sections, and complex graphic elements. A return to the origins of editorial design applied to the web.

### The Return of HTML

Finally I'm back to adding **HTML** concepts beyond CSS! In recent projects they were purely (the vast majority) about new CSS functions.

**Learning compromise:**
- **CSS:** Advanced grid layout, pseudo-elements, complex media queries, responsive typography
- **HTML:** Semantic structure (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`), accessibility, Font Awesome icons

The balance was perfect for consolidating both aspects.

### The Portfolio Temptation and the Wisdom of Waiting

Right between adding the commented HTML and creating this README, I realized it would have been much better to add **screenshots** of the final results of projects on GitHub. I got to researching GitHub Pages, custom domains, etc...

But at a certain point I asked myself: "Okay the enthusiasm, but you haven't finished Responsive Web Design from freeCodeCamp yet. Okay, you're at the end, okay, you've come a long way, a few months ago you didn't even know how to head an HTML, but you still haven't learned JavaScript or React."

### The Decision for Authenticity

I decided to be true from the first project and tell my whole journey, and I'm still doing it now. **I'll add screenshots from now on**, but the best portfolio is one I make **after learning**, not while I'm learning.

Regarding having decided to be authentic, I could have improved the README files of the first projects that were really "bare", but I didn't do it because the goal here is to show the entire process. I'm not on Instagram where everyone shows the best version of themselves - here I show my real learning story.

Given that I already know I'll never stop learning, because when you seriously and passionately do a profession you're a **professional** and at the same time a **lifelong student**. At least create it properly after completing the path I've created for myself:

### My Learning Path

- **Responsive Web Design** (freeCodeCamp)
- **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** (freeCodeCamp)
- **Front End Development Libraries** (freeCodeCamp)
- **Epic React** (Kent C. Dodds)
- **Become a Designer** (Breccia)
- **Google UX Design**
- **Degree in Industrial Design**
- **Refactoring UI**
- **Many design and code books**
- **Maybe a nice bootcamp**

### The Project Itself

Returning to the project, I liked it just as I had predicted in the other README. Although I'm not a fan of articles written in newspaper style with columns, I understood where freeCodeCamp was going: **start from where it all began** - the printed newspaper.

It's a brilliant didactic approach: first you learn the layout that has defined visual communication for centuries, then you can innovate consciously. The principles of hierarchy, columns, spacing of newspapers are the foundation of every modern editorial design.

### CSS Grid: When It Makes Sense

Refactoring UI tends to prefer simpler solutions, but CSS Grid has its legitimate use cases:
- **Editorial layouts** like this magazine
- **Dashboards** with defined functional areas
- **Complex image galleries**
- **Landing pages** with overlapping sections

I believe (but I could be wrong) that the important thing is not to abuse it when Flexbox would do the same job more simply.

### Final Reflection

The time spent exploring GitHub Pages won't be wasted. **One day I'll connect the dots**.

### What I Learned

**CSS:**
- **CSS Grid** for complex bidimensional layouts
- **Responsive typography** with precise media queries
- **Object-fit** for intelligent image management
- **Pseudo-elements** for automatic quotation marks
- **Optimized font loading** with Google Fonts
- **The font-size: 62.5% trick** - converts the base from 16px to 10px (16px Ã— 62.5% = 10px), making rem calculations super simple!

**HTML:**
- **`<aside>`** for semantically related content
- **loading="lazy"** for optimized image loading
- **rel="noreferrer"** - though I discovered it's like closing one window while leaving 10 others open! It only blocks the referrer header, but Google Analytics and other trackers do the rest of the work. It's more a "gesture of courtesy" than real protection.
