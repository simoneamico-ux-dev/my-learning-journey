CSS Flexbox Photo Gallery

What I Learned:
- Using Flexbox (`display: flex`, `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, `gap`) to create a responsive, beautiful gallery
- Responsive layout tricks (max-width, margin auto)
- Styling images with `object-fit: cover` and border-radius for a polished, modern look
- The utility of pseudo-elements (`::after`) for layout control

Personal Note:  
This is my favorite project so far â€” I absolutely love the way it looks. Seeing the visual result come together was really satisfying and motivating.  
I'm now working on a vademecum: a living, real-world HTML & CSS handbook that I'll keep updating as I learn, always linking techniques to their everyday equivalents.
