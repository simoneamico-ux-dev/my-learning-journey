# Technical Documentation Page - freeCodeCamp Project

### The Project
Technical documentation page about Git and GitHub, developed as a freeCodeCamp certification project. A comprehensive manual that serves both as reference and personal learning tool.

### The Evolution of Approach

I applied everything I'm learning from Refactoring UI. In these 3 days I also finished the 2nd Google UX course (2/8) and it was fascinating to learn **persona** and **user journey** and apply them directly to the project, especially because they're taught differently compared to Breccia's course.

### The Disciplined Method

I rigorously followed the requirements for names and elements requested by freeCodeCamp. Other times I went freestyle, then adjusted according to required specifications. It was much faster this way, even though I had less fun. I like that sense of freedom, but I understand I still need to learn all methods before autonomously choosing the best one.

### The Driver's License Analogy

A bit like getting a driver's license: you learn exactly as the instructor wants, but then the steering wheel height, gear changes, maneuvers will be up to you to decide.

### Reflection on Work Teams

I understand it's also necessary at a corporate level. Startups and very small teams are one thing where your work has a huge impact, in larger teams you'll necessarily be a small percentage and won't be able to decide everything, even though I'm sure you can still have enormous impact there too.

### The Content Choice

I decided to choose **Git and GitHub** as the documentation subject. I could have chosen HTML and CSS which I'm starting to understand, but I already have the Handbook for that. I opted to learn something I don't know thoroughly like the platform I'm writing on, researching and then reporting on the page.

**Surprise:** I was amazed that I already knew the vast majority of functions from when I first researched them about 2 months ago.

### The Refactoring UI Method in Practice

I approached it following the Refactoring UI method:

1. **Last night** until late I reviewed my notes
2. **This morning** I transferred everything I'd need for the project to a txt file
3. **I called it "in advance"** - colors, distances, fonts, everything predefined
4. **Grayscale design** first to establish hierarchies and distances without being "distracted" by color
5. **Design something functional** then iterate until perfect

I really liked this method!

### The Discovered Limit and Discipline

I would have also liked to add that when scrolling the page, the navbar would show exactly where you were. I immediately discovered that was **JavaScript** territory, which I'm still waiting to learn. With pure CSS I could only achieve having a nav link stay highlighted after clicking it, but I wanted something interactive.

I decided to **be patient** even though I can't wait to start JavaScript. This is my path: it doesn't make sense to pick things here and there that I haven't studied, until I've internalized and thoroughly understood them.

### The Final Goal

I want to internalize all this. I'd like to reach the **confidence** of sitting down and already knowing what's best to do, a bit like when I use Figma. Nevertheless, I admit I have much more fun coding, as I said in some past README.

### What I Learned

- **Technical documentation** structured and navigable
- **Rigorous implementation** of specific requirements
- **Refactoring UI methodology** applied to a real project
- **Git/GitHub** deepened while documenting them
- **Design system planning** with "in advance" file
