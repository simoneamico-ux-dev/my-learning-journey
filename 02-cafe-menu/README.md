Cafe Menu - My First CSS Project

What I Learned:

- CSS syntax and selectors
- Styling text and layout basics
- Class vs. ID selectors
- Using the box model (padding, margin, border)
- Applying colors and fonts
- Accessibility considerations for styled elements
- The :hover pseudo-class for interactive effects

ðŸ’¡ Discovering the hover effect was especially exciting!  
Even though itâ€™s a simple feature, it immediately made me feel at home in the world of UX/UI seeing elements respond to user interaction was truly satisfying.

Time: 5 hours learning + 1 hour 12 min commenting
