Registration Form – Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form

What I Learned:
- Structuring forms with `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, and `<label>`
- Radio buttons vs. checkboxes
- Required fields, input validation with pattern, min/max
- Form styling and responsive layout with CSS
- Label-input association for accessibility
- Using type="file", textarea, and select dropdown

Personal Note: This part was slightly less exciting than previous ones — not because it lacked value, but because I’ve been more drawn to styling and color-based projects. Still, I really enjoyed seeing the form come together responsively. It was rewarding to observe how structure and logic began to shape a real application flow, giving it more substance and purpose.
