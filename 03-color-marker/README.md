Colored Markers – CSS Color Practice

What I Learned:
- CSS syntax and selector structure
- Using class-based styling for reusable components
- display: inline-block for horizontal layout while maintaining block features
- Understanding the box model: width, height, margin

- Applying different color models:
- rgb() for red-green-blue definitions
- rgba() for transparency control
- hex for compact color values
- hsl() for hue-saturation-lightness control

- Creating linear gradients with linear-gradient()
- Using box-shadow for depth and highlight effects
- Structuring HTML with nested divs to simulate real-world components
- Importance of separating visual parts into semantic building blocks (cap, sleeve, body)

Interesting takeaway:
Learning how to combine gradients with shadows to simulate lighting and 3D effects was particularly engaging. It helped solidify the idea that CSS is not just for color but also for mood and dimension.

Personal Note:
This exercise reminded me of skeuomorphism, an interface style I’ve always been fond of. 
As a child, I had an iPod Touch running iOS 5, with an interface full of realistic visual details and textures that I found fascinating. 
I still remember when I jailbroke the device — a process that allowed me to customize and modify the system in ways not intended by Apple.
That experience sparked my curiosity for customization and design.
