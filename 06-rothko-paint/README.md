Rothko Painting â€“ CSS Visual Practice

What I Learned

- HTML layout with nested divs to build abstract compositions

- CSS techniques for expressive visuals: 

  - filter: blur() for soft, painterly edges

  - box-shadow and border-radius for depth and shape variation

  - transform: rotate() for natural imperfection

- Color blocking and visual hierarchy using only CSS

- How layout, effects, and proportions come together to simulate artwork

Personal Note
I had a lot of fun with this one more than with static forms or standard layouts. As soon as the project took a visual direction, I felt lit up inside, maybe thanks to my design background. It's surprising how motivated I was: I literally coded part of this while ferry-hopping around an island. That moment made me realizeâ€¦ maybe this really is passion.
