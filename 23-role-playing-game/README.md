### The Project

Dragon Repeller RPG developed by integrating JavaScript with HTML and CSS, featuring combat system, inventory management, multiple locations and complete game mechanics. The first project that combines logic, interface and user interaction.

### The Most Challenging Experience

It was a very long and most tiring project done so far. It was difficult to enter the logic of JavaScript and I still don't feel comfortable.

Halfway through the project I took a complete day off where I only read a few pages of Refactoring UI, I needed it to recharge.

### The Moments of Joy

As soon as I started the project I began with **great energy** writing HTML and CSS, with the same energy also the assignment of CSS elements to JavaScript, like buttons.

I admit that **functions and if/else loops also entertained me** (even if less than the previously mentioned areas), maybe because by repeating them continuously throughout the project I started to feel **confident** - and this is exactly what brings me joy in doing it.

### The Achilles' Heel

**For loops are my Achilles' heel**. Better than the last project, but I can't reach the level of abstraction it requires.

### An Encouraging Discovery

I researched and discovered that **for a designer's mind, it's normal to find for loops more difficult, particularly compared to if/else statements**. I'm sure that throughout the course, with all the projects there will be, **I will learn to master them completely**.

### What I Learned

**DOM Manipulation:**

- **document.querySelector()** to select HTML elements

- **onclick events** to handle user interactions

- **innerText and innerHTML** to dynamically update content

- **style.display** to show/hide elements

**Game Logic:**

- **State management** with global variables

- **Object arrays** for weapons, monsters, locations

- **Dynamic UI updates** based on game state

- **Conditional game flow** with multiple locations

**Advanced JavaScript:**

- **Math.random()** for random elements

- **Array methods** (push, pop, shift, includes)

- **Complex conditionals** for game mechanics

- **Function composition** for interconnected systems

**HTML/CSS/JS Integration:**

- **Responsive button behavior** with JavaScript

- **Dynamic content updates** maintaining CSS styling

- **Event handling** for user interactions

- **Real-time stats display** synchronized with game state

### Observed Development Patterns

**Game Architecture:**

- **Locations system** - each location has button texts and functions

- **Update pattern** - central function that updates entire UI

- **State persistence** - global variables to maintain progress

**Combat System:**

- **Turn-based logic** with attack/dodge/run options

- **Damage calculation** with mathematical formulas

- **Random elements** for gameplay variety

### Reflection

I'm happy with the **confidence** I've developed with functions and if/else loops - it gives me faith that loops will also become natural with practice.
