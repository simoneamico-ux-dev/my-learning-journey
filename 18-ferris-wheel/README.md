# Ferris Wheel - freeCodeCamp Project

### The Project
Animated ferris wheel developed with CSS Animations, @keyframes and advanced transforms. A project that marked a turning point in connecting Figma and code.

### The Revolutionary Connection

**This project was amazing!** Here I connected **Figma with code** like never before.

As usual I didn't stop at learning what freeCodeCamp taught me, but I deepened many parts. One in particular where I want to focus is **animations**.

### The Animation Deep Dive

With this project I should have only learned `linear` and `ease-in-out`, but remembering the names I decided to **deepen animations** to know all those I learned in Breccia's UI/UX design course, making a complete selection that I'll add to the handbook.

### The Figma â†’ CSS Translation Table

| **IN FIGMA READ** | **IN CSS WRITE** | **WHEN** |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Linear | `linear` | ðŸ¤– Mechanical |
| Ease | `ease` | ðŸ˜Œ Natural |
| Ease In | `ease-in` | ðŸš€ Accelerates |
| Ease Out | `ease-out` | ðŸ›‘ Slows down |
| Ease In and Out | `ease-in-out` | ðŸŽ¢ Smooth |
| Custom Bezier | `cubic-bezier(0.87,0,0.24,0.99)` | ðŸŽ­ Your style |
| Smart Animate | `animation: name 300ms ease;` | ðŸŽ¬ Animate |

### Immediate Practical Application

It was an **important step** that will surely be useful in the prototyping phase. Just yesterday I finished the wireframes to complete **Google UX course 3** where I used a Smart Animate Custom Bezier with values `0.87, 0, 0.24, 0.99` 800ms that gave animations **like a rocket that gently brakes**.

**Today I learned** that I can translate it to CSS with:
```css
animation: animationname 800ms cubic-bezier(0.87, 0, 0.24, 0.99);
```

### What I Learned

**CSS Animations:**
- **@keyframes** to define animation sequences
- **animation-name, animation-duration, animation-iteration-count**
- **animation-timing-function** with all variants
- **transform-origin** for custom rotation points

**CSS Transforms:**
- **rotate()** for precise rotations
- **transform-origin** for pivot point control
- **nth-of-type()** to select specific elements

**Figma-CSS Integration:**
- **Direct translation** from Smart Animate to CSS animation
- **Custom Bezier curves** for personalized animations
- **Perfect timing** between prototype and implementation

### Reflection

This project demonstrated how powerful it is to **not stop** at minimum requirements. Deepening animations will allow me to prototype in Figma knowing exactly how to implement everything in CSS. It's the perfect union between design and development.
