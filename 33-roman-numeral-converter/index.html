<!-- DESIGN 
   ------
   * This HTML is characterized by:
   * - importing Roboto Slab and Roboto fonts from Google Fonts.
   *   I chose these fonts because Roboto Slab has classic shapes
   *   that evoke ancient Rome,
   *   Roboto (for input and button) provides modernity, 
   *   readability and consistency with Material Design 3
   * - a div structure with exception of the card container, where
   *   I chose <main> for semantic purposes

        <!-- * freeCodeCamp instructions:
             * - You should have an input element with an id of "number".
             * - You should have a button element with an id of "convert-btn".
             * - You should have a div, span or p element with an id of output. 
             
             * I'll create separate divs to allow me in CSS phase to position
             * each component exactly as in Figma
             
             * I must remember to write "number" for type of input to restrict
             * input to numeric characters, which is more efficient than using 
             * regex in JavaScript
             * I did some research and found out that input type="number" uses
             * browser native validation operating with an underlying C/C++ engine,
             * while regex is executed by the JavaScript interpreter.
             * However, I still need to use JavaScript to avoid "e" and ","
