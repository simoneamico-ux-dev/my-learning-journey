## The Project
Tribute page dedicated to Don Norman, pioneer of user-centered design and author of "The Design of Everyday Things". A book I literally devoured because I loved it so much!

### Development Reflections

It was easier and faster than expected! Despite working the night shift, I managed to complete 75% of the project yesterday. Today, in about an hour, I finished the refinement part, which was based on debugging the site: shrinking the window, testing with smartphone and so on.

### The Refactoring UI Approach in Practice

I applied the approach I'm learning from **Refactoring UI**: it's better to first do all the "rough" work that allows you to have something in hand, even if basic, then choose colors, fonts and so on. This is also because it will be much easier to detect hierarchies and problems in a grayscale site/app.

### The 8px Rule

Another very interesting thing: UI and UX rules learned from the Breccia course and the aforementioned book are increasingly crowding my mind. An example was adopting the **8px rule**, establishing hierarchies and maintaining multiples of 8px to make them visually hierarchical while also ensuring adequate breathing space between elements.

### The Question That's Buzzing in My Head

Maybe this is exactly what distinguishes a developer from a UX engineer? Maximum attention to details like these?

I had a blast working on this project and can't wait to move on to the next one.
